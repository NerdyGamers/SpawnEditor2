# TODO

- [ ] Migrate project to modern .NET (e.g., .NET 6)
  - [x] Convert `.csproj` to SDK-style and run `dotnet build` (build currently fails: missing `System.Resources.Extensions`).
  - [x] Resolve build errors and update `TargetFramework` to `net6.0-windows` (build still fails: WindowsDesktop reference pack missing on non-Windows host).
  - [x] Replace deprecated WinForms controls (`ContextMenu`, `StatusBar`) with supported alternatives.
- [ ] Replace COM dependencies with managed alternatives
  - [x] Research libraries to replace `UOMap.ocx` and `AxUOMAPLib.dll`
    - Investigated `ClassicUO/ClassicUO` and `UOMap/uomap-client`; no drop-in WinForms control identified yet.
  - [x] Implement basic managed map control
    - [x] Render actual map tiles and spawn overlays
    - [x] Remove COM references from setup project
    - [x] Render static tiles and cache blocks for speed
- [ ] Add automated unit tests
  - [x] Choose a test framework (NUnit) and set up a test project.
  - [x] Write tests covering existing functionality.
- [ ] Introduce continuous integration
  - [x] Create a GitHub Actions workflow to run `dotnet build`.
  - [x] Build on Windows runners.
  - Next: Verify Windows workflow passes after adding Windows Desktop workload installation.
- [ ] Verify static tile rendering accuracy across the entire map (elevations, hues).
- [ ] Profile large map rendering for performance improvements.
- [ ] Improve developer documentation
  - [x] Document build and setup steps in `README.md`.
  - Next: Expand usage examples and contribution guidelines.
